### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics covered in the labs provided a solid foundation for completing the assignment, but I found myself needing to do additional research and self-learning to successfully implement certain features. Interacting with an API was hard when it came to handling edge cases. I had to take into account how to load more data and the correct data depending on the search query.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have added additional features to enhance the functionality and user experience of the project. One idea could be implementing a search filter to allow users to search for specific movies. I would also explore integrating external APIs to fetch more detailed movie information or display related movies.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

During the project demo, things went well overall. The functionality of the movie search and display worked as intended with continuous reiterations. However, there were some minor issues with styling and responsiveness that could have been improved. While observing my peers' demos, I noticed some creative approaches to UI/UX design and code organization that I would like to incorporate in my future projects.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out
